# Predicting Absolute Risk for a Person with Missing Risk Factors: Simulation Study
This repository contains the R code and related files used for the simulation study presented in the paper "Predicting absolute risk for a person with missing risk factors".

## Overview

The simulation study focuses on the development, evaluation, and comparison of statistical methods aimed at predicting absolute risk  when there are missing risk factors for an individual. The code in this repository was utilized to produce all simulation results presented in Section 3. Simulation of the paper.

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or later)
- Required R packages: (e.g., `tidyverse`, `mice`, ...). Please check the `MDRP simulation Github.R` file for a full list.
